- 👋 Hi, I’m @Hammo11
- 👀 I’m interested in ... Learning everything to do with my snap maker three in one 3D printer CNC and laser 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...everything basically I mean I can put it all together and I have used computers. I haven't currently learnt any coding or how to write a print file and everything I need to be competent in operating all functions of the snap maker
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...I'm basically new to this all but I've done a lot off research no the best affordable and practical easy to use and learn 
- 📫 How to reach me ...hammoztec@hmail.com mobile 0422982573 and I live in Sandhurst Melbourne Australia 3977 and I encourage anyone that wants to reach out and give me some pointers that would be much appreciated. Thanks to all that read my profile and hope someone reaches out and it would be amazing if anyone has any advice at all. I'm really hoping I can find something to build that some good samaritan Has worked out all the coding and whatnot to copy and paste pretty much it would be great for my confidence that this is all totally learnable and I'll be able to build and learn the way Its intended but I have read a lot of comments that people have had all sorts of problems managing the simplest of tasks from a file to finished piece.
